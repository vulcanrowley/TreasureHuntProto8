Treasure Hunt base - reverted from tween experiment
first complete express, socketio, phaser and procedurally-generated Dungeon with imports that can send
a random number to the master html file and get the same dungeon generated on each additional client.

Design: NPM kicks off the Exchange server which launches the client when a users connects
to the LObby.
In the Lobby, player can see other players waiting , start a new game or join a game

Whenthe player joins a game, a Dungeon is generated in the client from a random setting - 'gameSeed' - assigned in the server so all clients create the same world
The clients collect user actions and send over socketio to the server, the server computes moves and returns to the clients who then repaint the client browser.[later add movement interpolation]
